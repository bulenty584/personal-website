# personal-website

=======
This is a web portfolio for myself, created using React.js and Tailwind CSS. It is a work in progress, and will be updated as I learn more about web development.

## Running the Website

To run the website yourself, simply clone the repository and run `npm install` in the root directory to install the necessary packages. Then run `npm start` to start the development server and open the website in your default browser.

## Technologies Used

- React.js
- Tailwind CSS
